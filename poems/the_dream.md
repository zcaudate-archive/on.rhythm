Wake me up, before I lose control
In this place of angels.
Hold me tight and never let me go,
Far too long I've walked alone.

Time stood still, when I saw your face
Blinding my expressions
Spoken dreams beyond the words I know
Quivering lips to fulfill.

<HINDI>

Watch me close, when I fall asleep
Tie me down with shadows
Come to me before you break free
Rest by the fork in the road.

Hear my soul's eternal reply
Could this be your answer?
Lost in creations of our lonely minds
Waiting to unite in sorrow.

<HINDI>
