```
I wish to convey the transiance of desire,
The original song was about eternal love and waiting - very simple and sweet. 
This version is still eternal, but it's about the eternity of change,
The ebb and flow of attraction within the impermanence of this world.
```

---------------------------

```
Wake me up, before I lose control
In this place of angels.
Hold me tight and never let me go,
Far too long I've walked alone.

Time stood still, when I saw your face
Arresting my expression
Spoken dreams beyond the words I know
Quivering lips to fulfill.

<HINDI CHORUS 1>

Hear my soul's eternal reply
Could this be your answer?
Lost in creations of our lonely minds
Aching to unite in sorrow.

<HINDI CHORUS 2>

Watch me close, when I fall asleep
Tie me down with shadows
Come to me before you break free
Rest by the fork in the road.

<HINDI and ENGLISH CHORUS 1, REPEATED>

<FINI>
Step by step, never to comply
Gaze at life's reflections
....
....
