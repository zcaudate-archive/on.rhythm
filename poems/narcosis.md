That which does not touch me,
cannot pierce me.
I am blinded by your hands against my brow
Please resist from holding on.
Let it go.

We share a common purpose.
A trait, a flicker.
We've danced to our hearts content,
our journeys, may they cross once more.

Drink, be merry, unwind and be still.
Forever travelling;
coming and going,
coming and going,
rejoicing in the rhythm of the breath,
the rhythm of the play.
