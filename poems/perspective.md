Those faces, resounding in silence.
they pass judgements,
all around this quiet calm.

We dance, the soloist and I.

Tax returns, credit cards, computer screens.
All meld into irrelevance at the time of death.

We remember not the machinery but that which
we have achieved despite them:

Sunlight, kisses, hugs and a lover's glance.
